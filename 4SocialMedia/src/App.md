import { useState } from 'react'
useState is a special function provided by React. It's a way for React components to manage their own state (i.e., their own data).


import "./App.css": This imports the CSS file for the App component. This file likely contains styles that are applied to the App component and its children.

import Header from './components/Header': This imports the Header component from the Header.js file located in the components directory.

import Footer from './components/Footer': This imports the Footer component from the Footer.js file located in the components directory.

import Sidebar from './components/Sidebar': This imports the Sidebar component from the Sidebar.js file located in the components directory.

import CreatePost from './components/CreatePost': This imports the CreatePost component from the CreatePost.js file located in the components directory.

import Post from './components/Post': This imports the Post component from the Post.js file located in the components directory.

import PostList from './components/PostList': This imports the PostList component from the PostList.js file located in the components directory.

import PostListProvider from './store/post-list-store': This imports the PostListProvider component from the post-list-store.js file located in the store directory.


function App() { ... }: This is a functional component named App. It is the main component of the application and is responsible for rendering the entire user interface.

const [selectedTab, setSelectedTab] = useState("Create Post"): This line uses the useState hook, which is a React Hook that allows you to add state to functional components. Here's a detailed explanation of what's happening:

selectedTab is a piece of state that represents the currently selected tab in the sidebar. Initially, it is set to the string "Create Post".
setSelectedTab is a function that is used to update the value of selectedTab. When called with a new value, it will re-render the component with the updated state.
return ( ... ): This is the return statement of the App component. It returns the JSX (JavaScript XML) that defines the structure of the component's UI. The JSX is enclosed in parentheses and consists of several nested components and HTML elements.

<PostListProvider> ... </PostListProvider>: This is a custom component named PostListProvider. It is a context provider that wraps the entire component tree. It provides the PostListContext to all components within its subtree, allowing them to access and update the postList state.

<div className="app-container"> ... </div>: This is a div element with the class name "app-container". It contains the entire application and is used to style the layout of the UI.

<Sidebar selectedTab={selectedTab} setSelectedTab={setSelectedTab}></Sidebar>: This is a custom component named Sidebar. It is responsible for displaying the sidebar navigation menu. It receives two props: selectedTab (the currently selected tab) and setSelectedTab (the function to update the selected tab).

<div className="content"> ... </div>: This is a div element with the class name "content". It contains the main content of the application, which can be either the PostList or CreatePost component depending on the value of selectedTab.

<Header></Header>: This is a custom component named Header. It is responsible for displaying the header of the application.

{selectedTab === "Create Post" ? (<PostList></PostList>) : (<CreatePost></CreatePost>)}: This is a ternary operator that conditionally renders either the PostList or CreatePost component based on the value of selectedTab. If selectedTab is "Create Post", it renders the CreatePost component. Otherwise, it renders the PostList component.

<Footer></Footer>: This is a custom component named Footer. It is responsible for displaying the footer of the application.

In summary, the App component is the main component of the application that renders the entire user interface. It uses the useState hook to manage the state of the currently selected tab in the sidebar. It also uses the PostListProvider context provider to provide the PostListContext to all components within its subtree. The App component contains several child components, including the Sidebar, Header, Footer, PostList, and CreatePost components. Depending on the value of selectedTab, it conditionally renders either the PostList or CreatePost component.
