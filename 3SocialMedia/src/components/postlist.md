Import Statements:

React: This is the core library for React. It's imported because we're using React components and hooks.
useContext: This is a hook provided by React that allows us to consume context within a functional component. Context is a way to share data between components without having to pass props manually through each level of the component tree.
Post: This is a component imported from a file. It's likely a component that represents a single post in a list of posts.
PostListContext: This is a context imported from a file. It's likely a context that provides a list of posts to the application.
Functional Component: PostList:

This is a functional component that returns JSX. Functional components are React components that are defined as functions.
It uses the useContext hook to access the postList from the PostListContext. The useContext hook allows us to access the value of a context within a functional component.
It returns a fragment (<></>) that contains a loop that iterates over each post in the postList and renders the Post component for each post. The key prop is used to uniquely identify each post in the list.
Export Statement:

The PostList component is exported as the default export of the file. This allows other files in the application to import and use the PostList component.
In summary, the PostList component is a functional component that consumes the postList from the PostListContext using the useContext hook. It then iterates over each post in the postList and renders the Post component for each post. This allows the PostList component to display a list of posts in the application.


{postList.map((post) => (
  <Post key={post.id} post={post}></Post>
))}
This code is using the .map() method to iterate over each item in the postList array and return a new array of Post components. Here's what each part does:

{postList.map((post) => (:

The { and } are used to embed JavaScript code within JSX.
postList is an array of post objects.
.map() is a JavaScript array method that creates a new array by calling a function on each item in the original array.
<Post key={post.id} post={post}></Post>:

For each post in the postList array, a Post component is created.
The key prop is set to post.id. React uses the key prop to identify which items have changed, been added, or been removed.
The post prop is set to the current post object from the array.
))}:

This closes the .map() method and the { and } used to embed JavaScript code within JSX.
In summary, this code iterates over each item in the postList array and returns a new array of Post components, each with a unique key and the corresponding post object as a prop. This is a common pattern in React for rendering lists of items.
