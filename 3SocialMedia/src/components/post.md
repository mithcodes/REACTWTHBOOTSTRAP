However, the map function is a JavaScript method that returns a new array based on the elements of the original array. It doesn't return a value that can be directly inserted into the JSX markup. Instead, you want to use the map function to generate a new array of JSX elements, and then insert that array into the markup.

To do this, you need to use parentheses () instead of curly braces {} to wrap the map function:

javascript
Copy code
{post.tags.map((tag) => (
  <span className="badge text-bg-primary hastag">{tag}</span>
))}
This way, the map function will return a new array of JSX elements, which can be inserted into the JSX markup using curly braces {}.
