Sure! Let's break down the provided code step by step:

Code Explanation:
1. Importing Redux:
javascript
Copy code
const redux = require('redux');
Importing the redux library to create the Redux store.
2. Initial State and Reducer:
javascript
Copy code
const INITIAL_VALUE = {
  counter: 0
};
Define the initial state with a counter set to 0.
javascript
Copy code
const reducer = (store = INITIAL_VALUE, action) => {
  let newStore = store;
  if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
    newStore = {counter: store.counter + 1};
  } else if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
    newStore = {counter: store.counter - 1};
  } else if (action.type === 'ADDITION') {
    newStore = {counter: store.counter + action.payload.number};
  }
  return newStore;
}
Define a reducer function to specify how the state changes in response to actions.
The reducer takes two arguments: store (current state) and action.
Depending on the action.type, it updates the counter in the state:
INCREMENT: Increases the counter by 1.
DECREMENT: Decreases the counter by 1.
ADDITION: Adds the number specified in the action payload to the counter.
3. Creating the Redux Store:
javascript
Copy code
const store = redux.createStore(reducer);
Create the Redux store using createStore function with the reducer.
4. Subscribing to the Store:
javascript
Copy code
const subscriber = () => {
  const state = store.getState();
  console.log(state);
}

store.subscribe(subscriber);
Define a subscriber function to log the current state whenever the store updates.
Subscribe the subscriber function to the store using store.subscribe(subscriber).
5. Dispatching Actions:
javascript
Copy code
store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'});
store.dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT'});
store.dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'});
store.dispatch({type: 'ADDITION', payload: {number: 7}});
store.dispatch({type: 'DECREMENT'});
Dispatch various actions to update the state in the store:
INCREMENT: Increases the counter by 1.
DECREMENT: Decreases the counter by 1.
ADDITION: Adds 7 to the counter using the payload.
Overall Flow:
Initial State & Reducer:
Define the initial state and a reducer function to handle state changes based on actions.
Creating Store:
Create a Redux store using the reducer.
Subscribing to Store:
Subscribe a subscriber function to the store to log the current state whenever it updates.
Dispatching Actions:
Dispatch various actions to update the counter in the state.
Console Output:
The subscriber logs the current state after each dispatch, showing how the state changes in response to the dispatched actions.
This code demonstrates the basic principles of Redux, including defining an initial state, creating a reducer to handle state changes, creating a Redux store, subscribing to the store to listen for updates, and dispatching actions to update the state.
